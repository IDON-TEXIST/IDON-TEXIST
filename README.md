# This exists unlike me
Hey did you know this is a thing? Profile readmes, crazy right?  
Like seriously why does literally no one do these  
It's so simple too, just make a public repo with your username as the name and github will notifiy you 17 times that this is a special repo! Yay!  
### Who am I?
An idiot who doesn't know how to code and made a github account for the lulz.
### Bruh
I agree
### I care about what you do in your life for some reason!
